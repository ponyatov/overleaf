\secly{Introduction}

Software development and program architecture engineering has grows complexity in last decades. This problem is especially notable in hard real-time control systems applied in safety-critical domains: avionics, aerospace, automobiles, and medicine, and covered by tons of safety reglaments and standards. \cite{book1}

If we look on some random typical software developer vacancies, we see huge amount of conventional requirements on knowledge and skills (emphasized in text), making developer live damn scary: to make yourself promising in your profession, you must spend an everyday self-learning in your work and spare time.

\begin{framed}
An experienced \emph{Java} programmer with \emph{R} experience is sought to participate in the continued design and development of a flexible, open-ended platform for \emph{bioinformatics} data integration, \emph{analysis}, and \emph{visualization}. This open-source platform \emph{distributes computations} across client, server, and \emph{grid} components. The candidate is expected to contribute to architecture design, \emph{visualization}, and \emph{web-GUI} implementation, \emph{integration} of \emph{existing algorithms}/programs, troubleshooting software bugs, and producing technical documentation. The position requires a Bachelor's Degree in \emph{Computer Science}, \emph{Engineering}, \emph{Mathematics}, \emph{Physics}, \emph{Bioinformatics}, or in a similar field or equivalent in education and experience, plus a minimum of three (3) years of related experience. At least 1 year of experience \emph{programming in a UNIX environment} is required, as well as 1 year of experience with \emph{R} and \emph{Java} programming, including experience with distributed file systems and cluster compute management, shell scripting on UNIX and experience in one scripting language, preferably \emph{Python}. Also desirable is familiarity with \emph{database} driven projects using \emph{MySQL} or a similar database system, \emph{SQL}, \emph{JDBC}, \emph{Linux}, and use of appropriate IDEs (e.g., \emph{Eclipse}), project management tools (e.g., \emph{ant}, \emph{subversion}), web technologies (web service frontend triple \emph{HTML}/\emph{CSS}/\emph{JavaScript}, \emph{tomcat}, \emph{php}, \emph{drupal}).
